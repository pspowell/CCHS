# Rebuilding the Champaign County Historical Society  
### A Member-Led Coalition for Transparency, Accountability, and Renewal

The Champaign County Historical Society is a community institution — built, funded, and guided by the people of Champaign County. When any nonprofit drifts away from transparency, loses touch with its membership, or becomes shaped by personality rather than mission, it is the responsibility of the members to course‑correct.

This website exists to **organize a coalition of members** committed to restoring CCHS to:

- lawful nonprofit governance,  
- open and timely access to records,  
- accountable board leadership,  
- and mission‑focused service to our community.

## Why This Coalition Exists

Recently, members and volunteers have raised serious concerns about:

- delays or refusals in providing board minutes and membership rosters,  
- decisions made without adequate member involvement,  
- inconsistent communication,  
- and a decline in organizational transparency and participation.

These issues are not personal. They are **structural governance problems** — and they are solvable.  **The board is still comprised of caring, dedicated volunteers**, it just lacks a healthy composition.

Ohio law (ORC 1702) gives members both the *right* and the *responsibility* to ensure nonprofits operate ethically and transparently. Our goal is not conflict; it is **restoration**.

## What We Aim to Achieve

This coalition is dedicated to four clear objectives:

### **1. Transparency**
Ensuring members have access to board minutes, rosters, financial reports, and other documents guaranteed by law and bylaws.

### **2. Accountability**
Ensuring board actions follow Ohio law, nonprofit best practices, and the Society's own bylaws.

### **3. Member Voice**
Restoring the active role of members in decisions, elections, and the direction of the organization.

### **4. Organizational Renewal**
Rebuilding trust, expanding participation, and re‑energizing CCHS as a respected cultural and historical institution.
